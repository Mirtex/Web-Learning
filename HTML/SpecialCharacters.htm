<h1>Special Characters testing ground</h1>
    <pre><p>Special characters are written with &amp;, so even "&amp;" cannot be written by itself.<br>
    Some other common special characters are written in the following way:
    &amp;lang;  - &lang;
    &amp;rang;  - &rang;
    &amp;lt;    - &lt;
    &amp;rt;    - &gt;
    &amp;amp;   - &amp;
    &amp;nbsp;  - (white space)</pre>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>To format text appropiately, the correct tool is CSS. We can achieve this through HTML, but it's not meant to. For example, the white space character is used for situations like a name you would want to stick together and not go over to the next line. (Like&nbsp;this&nbsp;phrase,&nbsp;for&nbsp;example,&nbsp;will&nbsp;always&nbsp;stay&nbsp;in&nbsp;one&nbsp;line&nbsp;together.)</p>
