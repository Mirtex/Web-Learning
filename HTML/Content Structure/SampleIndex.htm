      <p>This html file is meant to be used as an entry point to the rest of the files
      as well as a learning experience for me. This file is <b>also</b> meant <br>
      to be the sample document for content structuring, given its nature. Even though these files were done in par
      with a tutorial, <em>they are original</em>, <br> without copied content whatsoever (this includes images.)</p>

        <h3>Content summary:</h3>
          <h4>Basics Document:</h4>
          <p>This document contains the first learning experience with html, including simple formatting, headers <br> and
          general HTML document structure implementation (doctype, head, body, meta, etc.)</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Formatting Basics</h4>
        <p>This is a continued document with more in depth formatting of html documents. This content includes <br>
        basic formatting, pre-formatted text, headings, emphasis, etc.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Heading Basics</h4>
        <p>This document was a testing ground for proper heading usage and implementation. It contains both samples <br>
        and information of the implementation as well as some testing around with HTML rules. Finally, the first usage of <br>
        links was implemented to provide citation to helpful websites.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Image Basics</h4>
        <p>Within this document you can find the testing ground used to add images to an HTML file. <br>
        This was a simple test, adding an image and manipulating its size.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Special Characters</h4>
        <p>This document was used to test exactly that, special characters, given that some characters (like &lt; and &gt; <br>
          especially) are part of HTML syntax. Some explanation of usage and recommendations are given.</p>

        <aside role="complementary">
          <h4></h4>
          <p><b>Special Characters document notes:</b><br>
          This document contains a note section that mentions CSS. Even though CSS is part of my learning experiecne <br>
          it is not implemented throughout the HTML learning experience file <strong> on purpose</strong>and will be <br>
          implemented in its own separate file.</p>
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Links</h4>
        <p>This document is the testing ground for the implementation of links. This includes internal and external pages, <br>
        downloads, and modifications to provide specific results as the final presentation of the information. <br></p>

          <h3>Content structure implementations:</h3>
          <p>The following section goes through the structure tags implemented in this document. </p>
        </header>

        <p>This document contains the following content structure tags implemented: </p>
        <div class="structTag">
          <h4>&lt;nav&gt; tag</h4>
          <p>This tag was used to mark the html document navigation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="structTag">
          <h4>&lt;article&gt; tag</h4>
          <p>This tag was used to mark the main article section of this specific document.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="structTag">
          <h4>&lt;section&gt; tag</h4>
          <p>This tag was used to separated the descriptions of each html file.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="structTag">
          <h4>&lt;aside&gt; tag</h4>
          <p>This tag was used to mark the Special character notes given that is tangential information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="structTag">
          <h4>&lt;div&gt; tag</h4>
          <p>This tag was used in this section, to tag each individual piece. There might be better tags for this however. <br>
          In this case I am grouping them together due to future - fictional -  CSS usage (As stated above, this is HTML only.)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="structTag">
          <h4>&lt;header&gt; tag</h4>
          <p>This tag was used to mark the header of the body.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="structTag">
          <h4>&lt;footer&gt; tag</h4>
          <p>This tag was used to mark the footer of this page, which containes personal information about <br>
            the creator of these documents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="structTag">
          <h4>&lt;main&gt; tag</h4>
          <p>This tag was used to mark the main section of this document, which is simply the article. <br>
            This tag is used primarily of assistive devices, which is why it's important, even if it's being <br>
            overlayed around the article tag.</p>
