        <h1>Main heading title</h1>
        <h2>This is the first description title</h2>
        <p>This is the paragraph that is paired with the first sub-title we are observing here. Headings should always be used in relation to the structure of the document instead of simply letting the default sizes dictate the heading number. The number should always denote the level of importance. In this case, this will be the only h2, because this section is meant as an introduction to the following content.</p>
        <h3>My first heading (h3)</h3>
        <p>Since I already have my main description, I will utilize h3 from now on given that from now on all the information presented is in the same level of importance.</p>
        <h3>My second heading (h3)</h3>
        <p>Since I already have my main description, I will utilize h3 from now on given that from now on all the information presented is in the same level of importance.</p>
        <h3>My third heading (h3)</h3>
        <p>Since I already have my main description, I will utilize h3 from now on given that from now on all the information presented is in the same level of importance.</p>
        <p>This paragraph is missing the "/p" closing tag to test that they <i>are <b>optional</b> according to HTML specifications, this also applies to the tags html, head, body, p (as this example), dt, dd, li, option, thead, th, tbody, ty, td, tfoot and colgroup.</i>
            <p>Nevertheless, <strong>always close your tags.</strong></p>

        <h2>This is the second description title</h2>
        <p>There is no general rule as to how to use the heading levels, as long as they are used logically. Of course, this varies from person to person, and between companies, which is something to be mindful of.</p>
