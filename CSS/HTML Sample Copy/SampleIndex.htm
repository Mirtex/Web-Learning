        <h3>Content summary:</h3>

    <ol>
      <section>
          <li ><h4>Basics Document:</h4></li>
          <p>This document contains the first learning experience with html, including simple formatting, headers and
          general HTML document structure implementation (doctype, head, body, meta, etc.)</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <li value="2"><h4>Formatting Basics</h4></li>
        <p>This is a continued document with more in depth formatting of html documents. This content includes basic formatting, pre-formatted text, headings, emphasis, etc.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <li value="3"><h4>Heading Basics</h4></li>
        <p>This document was a testing ground for proper heading usage and implementation. It contains both samples and information of the implementation as well as some testing around with HTML rules. Finally, the first usage of links was implemented to provide citation to helpful websites.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <li value="4"><h4>Image Basics</h4></li>
        <p>Within this document you can find the testing ground used to add images to an HTML file. This was a simple test, adding an image and manipulating its size.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <li value="5"><h4>Special Characters</h4></li>
        <p>This document was used to test exactly that, special characters, given that some characters (like &lt; and &gt; especially) are part of HTML syntax. Some explanation of usage and recommendations are given.</p>

        <aside role="complementary">
          <p><b>Special Characters document notes:</b><br>
          This document contains a note section that mentions CSS. Even though CSS is part of my learning experiecne it is not implemented throughout the HTML learning experience file <strong> on purpose</strong>and will be implemented in its own separate file.</p>
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <li value="6"><h4>Links</h4></li>
        <p>This document is the testing ground for the implementation of links. This includes internal and external pages, downloads, and modifications to provide specific results as the final presentation of the information.</p>

        <div class="structTag">
          <dt><h4>&lt;div&gt; tag</h4></dt>
          <dd><p>This tag was used in this section, to tag each individual piece. There might be better tags for this however. In this case I am grouping them together due to future - fictional -  CSS usage (As stated above, this is HTML only.)</p></dd>
        </div>

        <div class="structTag">
